	<h1>Quest #3</h1>
	<h3>
	A new day a new adventure! Deep within the forest you are! Taking your toad friend with you to help carry essential items, as you pass by a dark tree a voice calls out from it! “You there young one” you look towards the tree and is amazed! “Well now, it has been a while since Iv seen one of your kind, they don’t go this far deep into the forest you see. Say will you okay with humoring this old tree and answer this little question of mine” you nod happily in agreement “Splendid! Now listen close, there was a gnome named Ruri who had six brothers, there was Jack, Tim, Hibby, Rek, Strunk, and Sibel, who was the 7th brother?”
