	<h1>Quest #1</h1>

	<h3>Early in the morning you set out on the forest near town, as you keep going deeper you notice that you’ve lost your way, you don’t recognize the area and you don’t know the direction you even came from. You hear a voice call out to you “Over here” and as you turn you notice a masked man sitting by the tree.
	<br><br>“Lost are we?” says the man “you’ve stumbled on the resting place of my friends”
	<br><br>As you look around you notice odd shaped stones. “Well you seem to be in a hurry so I’ll help you but in one condition, answer this simple riddle of mine” you nod, “very well then” 
	<br><br>“If you don’t keep me, I will break, what am I?” 
	</h3>
