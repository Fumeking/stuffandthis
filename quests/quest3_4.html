	<h1>Quest #4</h1>

	<h3>You sleep soundly at your bed and a dream starts to stir in your mind, you’re in a forest in the den of the nigh, you hear a voice call out to you “Over here young one” you look and see a majestic creature staring at you “You are not afraid? I am glad” it says “I am a dream walker, my domain is this realm you have found yourself in and I am glad for you are not a judgmental soul but tell me, if you were ever caught in a situation to leave a friend behind or stay with them, what will you do?”
